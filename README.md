## Brainstorm
This is my brainstorm, I will update into a proper ReadMe when I can be arsed
- No UI yet I want UI like ProtonPass // Nav panel on left // Main dashboard on load // buttons direct to sections?
- Want options for which algorithms to use // Quantum?
- Generate passwords // Select length // Select if to use special chars?
- Have small CPM logo // Tested this in Python UI and I fucked up and stopped
- Password searching
- Something like a vault feature from ProtonPass
- Backup / Restore
- Browser extension // Autofill?
- Check password breaches?
- CLipboard // Click to copy passwords
- QR code passwords??
- AI? // EVENTUALLY
- Add master password
